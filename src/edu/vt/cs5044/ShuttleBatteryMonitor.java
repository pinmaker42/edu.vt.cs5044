/**
 * A basic system to track the energy usage of an experimental electric shuttle bus as it operates.
 * The dedicated route is perfectly straight, and consists of equal length blocks, numbered
 * sequentially from negative numbers in one direction to positive numbers in the other direction,
 * with block zero in the middle of the route. There is a recharging station located at block zero.
 *
 * The shuttle makes a series of non-stop trips between locations. Passengers may board and/or exit
 * the shuttle while it is stopped. No energy is used while the shuttle is stopped, nor while the
 * shuttle is empty. Energy usage is based upon the distance of each trip, and how many passengers
 * are on board during the trip. Trips are considered either long or short, depending on a
 * configurable distance limit.
 *
 * Short trips, up to the prevailing limit, use energy at a single fixed rate for the entire trip.
 * Long trips, longer than the prevailing limit, use energy at two different rates. For the short
 * portion of the trip, the usage is the same as for a short trip. For the remainder of the
 * distance, the trip uses energy at a different rate, and may travel faster or slower per block.
 *
 * ACADEMIC NOTE: Use only primitive types int and double, with all fields stored as int type.
 *
 * ACADEMIC NOTE: You may NOT use any methods of the Math class, except as explicitly specified in
 * the comments below.
 *
 * ACADEMIC NOTE: You may NOT use any of the following: branches; loops; conditionals; arrays; or
 * collections. We haven't yet covered any of these topics well enough quite yet, and it's also a
 * great exercise to produce a solution without them anyway.
